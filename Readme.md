1. What we expect ? ...

I partly agree with this thought, but I don't think frontend will change much in the next 3-4 years.

To take the place of one of the three major frameworks, you need to have a good and convenient API, a large community and a strong open-source, which web components don't have.

- if you want to split up monoliths in small pieces, you can use Next.

2. Date conversion library

In my opinion working with date and with timezone, is very complex, and you need to be careful and have strict rules for conversion. So I prefer to use a reliable library (date-fns) for these tasks

P.S.
Bonus 4 task: legacy build in dist folder
