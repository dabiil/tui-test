**What we expect ?** ...

I partly agree with this thought, but I don't think frontend will change much in the next 3-4 years.

To take the place of one of the three major frameworks, you need to have a good and convenient API, a large community and a strong open-source, which web components don't have.

if you want to split up monoliths in small pieces, you can use Next.

**Date conversion library**

In my opinion working with date and with timezone, is very complex, and you need to be careful and have strict rules for conversion. So I prefer to use a reliable library (date-fns) for these tasks

P.S.
Bonus 4 task: legacy build in dist folder
